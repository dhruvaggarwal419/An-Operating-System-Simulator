# An Operating System Simulator

Overview:-

The Operating System Simulator is an educational tool designed to demonstrate core OS concepts through interactive simulations. Developed using Python, C++, and Streamlit, this project offers visualizations and implementations of:
Memory Management Algorithms: First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit.
Process Scheduling Algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling.
Disk Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK.

This simulator serves as a practical resource for students and educators to understand and visualize fundamental operating system algorithms.
app.py: Main Streamlit application integrating all modules.
disk_scheduling_python.py: Implements disk scheduling algorithms.
memory_management.cpp & memory_management_python.py: Memory management implementations in C++ and Python.
process_scheduling.cpp, process_scheduling_chart.cpp, process_scheduling_python.py: Process scheduling implementations and visualizations.
memory_management_storage_file.txt: Simulates memory blocks for allocation.
